# LG-Dual-Screen-IME-Keyboard
use LG private api to transport any IME softkeyboard into second screen

LG G8X dual screen is convenient for coding. But the build-in LG keyboard sucks, and other 3rd party soft keyboard IME is not supported dual screen.

So I have to hack into LG keyboard and find out the magic private API that can transport any IME into second screen.

So here it is the magic API:

Class.forName("android.view.inputmethod.InputMethodManager").getMethod("setForceInputMethodLandscape", Boolean.TYPE).invoke(inputMethodManager, Boolean.valueOf(z));

But you can not call it directly because it is private API and in blacklist, use this ​https://github.com/tiann/FreeReflection​​​ to bypass the limitation.

the screenshot is the hacker's keyboard on second screen, though buggy, but it works!
